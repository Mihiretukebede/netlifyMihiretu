<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a postdoctoral researcher in the division of Cancer Epidemiology at the German Cancer Research Centre(DKFZ) in Heidelberg. My current research is on a large systematic review project which aims to synthesize the evidence on key mechanistic pathways for the causal link between adiposity and gynecological cancers. With my colleagues, I am also currently evaluating natural language processing methods and varieties of machine learning algorithms for speeding up our systematic review process. Automating the title/abstract screening stage of the review will help us cut down the time required to manually screen thousands of title/abstracts. 

My research interest is broad but generally in epidemiological and digital health research methods applied to diabetes, cancer, and other chronic diseases. Methodologically, I am interested in observational methods, systematic reviews and meta-analysis, and contemporary approaches such as machine learning applications in disease risk and health care prognosis prediction.. :et:
